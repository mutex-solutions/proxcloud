# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Offer NGINX Gateway Fabric 2.8.1 with Gateway API Standard 1.6.3 for new managed
  Kubernetes clusters (tenant chart 0.1.10). Keep the controller opt-in, users owning
  application Gateway/Routes/TLS, and existing ingress-nginx traffic unchanged.
  Validate actual chart/Kubernetes capability before effects, preserve sparse-client
  addon choices and refuse implicit legacy controller migration or downgrade.

- Refresh installation, developer, product-help, CI/release and support documentation
  against current configuration. Distinguish preview/source-build state from
  versioned publication and live acceptance, and document static template networking,
  scheduler defaults and intentional sandbox safety holds. No release is created by
  this documentation update.
- Replace application RabbitMQ dispatch with primary PostgreSQL durable native
  billing jobs: frozen original cycles, fenced at-least-once workers, atomic
  all-provider financial receipt/ACK, transactional enqueue, bounded retry/dead
  letters and audited operator replay. Reject old fanout flags until legacy queues
  are drained/reconciled; scheduler stays off by default. Optional read-only pool
  serves lag-tolerant history only. Fresh Compose/chart/installer defaults are
  broker-free; existing broker state still requires explicit drain/reconcile and
  retention. Bounded mail outbox machinery and opt-in enqueue producers are
  separate from production delivery, which remains disabled.

### Fixed

- Bind client order reads to the stored billing profile's current organization
  read permission, return an opaque 404 when denied and serialize a typed order.
  Require role-management permission for all custom organization role assignments
  while preserving ordinary MEMBER invitations; reject unknown roles and malformed
  role requests. Private native sandbox services on port 49983 now require their
  traffic token; only actual envd-serving pods retain envd's own-auth exemption.
  Add native repository and proxy regression coverage; no held feature is enabled.

- Require verified configured-host TLS before legacy SMTP credential authentication,
  including LOGIN-only and AUTH-stripped relays. Guard LOGIN independently against
  plaintext and host mismatch; preserve explicit NoAuth relay compatibility and
  PLAIN preference. No outbox delivery, relay configuration or live send is enabled.

- Protect full and sampled Proxmox SERVER/VOLUME/IMAGE reconciliation from
  filtered, malformed or unreadable VM inventories. Same-credential scoped proof
  and whole-row CAS preserve cache/history on unknown reads; identity retirement
  requires complete existing ACL/node authority. Delay protection healing until
  proof succeeds. Orphan IP cleanup now requires authoritative VM/address non-use
  and exact allocation/archive receipts instead of age or bulk NIC release;
  ambiguous reuse, other guest NICs and legacy/BeforeRow allocations stay held.
- Fail closed on permission-filtered PVE NETWORK inventories: prove effective
  same-token visibility and revalidate omitted networks/subnets before cache
  writes, preserving tenant rows and NAS exports on unknown results while genuine
  delete-of-vanished still archives normally. Surface typed repair warnings.
- Refuse conflicting TrueNAS provider owners on the same project's NAS backend and
  parent dataset before share/export mutations or duplicate share caching, rather
  than letting different provider settings repeatedly rewrite the same exports.

Initial ProxCloud development line: a self-service private-cloud and billing portal
for Proxmox VE. No versioned release has been published yet; the first preview needs
coherent artifact/BOM pins and published-artifact installation acceptance. History
from the product this codebase was forked from is not carried over.
